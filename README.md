USB light holder for Prusa i3 MK3
==

The purpose of this part is to hold the USB light on top of the Prusa i3 3D printer, making it easy to see the build volume.

The holder utilizes a hexagonal hole in the Prusa i3 top Z-axis mount.

It fits the hole and holds a USB cable.

In my case, a USB cable attaches to a Raspberry PI running Octoprint. I use a simple USB light stick on the other side of the cable. Light is on only when the 3D printer is in use.

The extruder casts a little shadow, but the print bed is much more visible now.

Printing
--
The part prints fine without any supports or brim. I used 0.3mm layer height and printed in PLA.

I attached .STEP files to make it easier to modify to your own cable thickness.
